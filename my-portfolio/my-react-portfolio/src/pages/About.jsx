        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>A full-stack developer with a passion for building user-friendly, efficient, and scalable applications. Currently enrolled in UCFâ€™s Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp (graduating May 2025), I specialize in JavaScript, React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL, with hands-on experience in frontend and backend development. With a background in electrical work, leadership, and customer service, I thrive in problem-solving environments that require adaptability and teamwork. My experience as an electrician has strengthened my analytical thinking, while my years in management and customer service have honed my ability to communicate, lead teams, and create solutions that prioritize user experience. I enjoy building clean, functional, and intuitive applications, whether it's a command-line employee management system or a portfolio site. My approach to development is structured, detail-oriented, and always focused on continuous learning.</p>
